        My boyfriend is so sweet
        <br>
        He says things like good morning and good night.
        <br><br>
        My boyfriend doesn’t use pet names
        <br>
        He doesn’t refer to me at all
        <br><br>
        My boyfriend is a clandestine chemist.
        <br>
        He stays up late wrangling his giant machines like demons, 
        <br>
        sweat dripping from his pock-marked brow, gritting his tarred, chipped teeth
        <br>
        and he comes home early in the morning and lurks like a smudge in the mirror. 
        <br><br>
        My boyfriend smells like chlorine and spray sealant
        <br>
        and I think it’s okay.
        <br><br>
        My boyfriend goes by Lance
        <br>
        His parents met following The Dead
        <br><br>
        My boyfriend relays secret coded messages in my ConEd bills and in the chat rooms of browser-based children’s games. 
        <br><br>
        He slips on grease, he weeps curled up on concrete floors, he is cold in his affect and inarticulate, he has learned to leave himself and I’m afraid he’ll leave me soon, too
        <br><br>
        My boyfriend only drinks Diet Coke,
        <br>
        I don’t think he knows himself at all. 
        <br><br>
        My boyfriend moves with great intention,
        <br>
And he hopes with this,
<br>
His body might slowly change,
<br>
And one day become something better. 
<br><br>
My boyfriend thinks the world is stupid
<br>
He thinks he’s smarter than me
<br><br>
My boyfriend holds me down and makes me tell him he is good
<br>
But when I look up at him all I can see are the clusters of moles,
<br>
spreading across his chest
<br>
And they look back at me, throbbing with malignance,
<br>
as his body constructs its own annihilation,
<br>
And I say I think he is good.
